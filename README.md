**About Progate**

**Vision**

Empowering everyone to open new doors
through programming.

We believe programming is a power that can change ourselves, our surroundings, and the world, regardless of age, gender, race, or position. We want everyone to have this wonderful power. And we want to open new doors of many lives alone.

**Mission**

Be the gate to the exciting world of programming.
Be the path to an independent coder.

Learning to code gave us the power to create. It gave us confidence and opened new doors. We want to make this power accessible to anyone, and open up the possibilities for everyone.

**Founder Message**

Learning to code changed our lives.

This is at the heart of everything we do at Progate.

Before I really learned how to code, I was just a student who couldn't do anything. I was taking computer science classes, but I didnâ€™t think programming was fun and I only felt frustrated.

But then I started learning programming with my friends, and as we gained experience through trial and error, we were eventually able to land freelance jobs. That feeling of achievement and being totally absorbed in the joy of creating something is one that I will never forget.

On July 31st of 2014, Kenta Murai and I started Progate with the mission, "Be the gate to the exciting world of programming. Be the path to an independent coder."

Programming is a powerful tool that can change your life.

We hope that you will give it a try, and we will be here to help you take your first step.
